# Learning algorithms

learning | definition
---|---
supervised | training set includes desired solution (label)
semi-supervised | only part of the training set is labelled
unsupervised | training daata is unlabelled
self-supervised | generate full labelled data set from unlabelled one
reinforced | train agents to pick the actions that will maximize their rewards

## Algorithms

type of tasks:

- classification task
  - image processing
  - natural language processing NLP for text classification
- regression task
  - predicting values

other classifications:

- instance-based vs model-based: compare new data points to known data points or detect pattern and build model
- online vs batch (offline): incrementaly on the fly or must be trainied using all available data
  - out-of-core: load part of the data, run training part
  - learning rate

unsupervised techniques:

- dimensionality reduction, feature extraction
- association rule learning: discover interesting relations between attributes
- anomality detection
- novelity detection: detect new instances that look different from all instances
